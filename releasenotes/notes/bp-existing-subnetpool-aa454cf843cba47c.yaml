    Support creating a Docker network with existing subnetpool. Users can use
    the option "neutron.pool.name" to specify the name of existing neutron
    subnetpool.
upgrade:
  - |
    The semantic of the option "neutron.pool.name" is changed. This option was
    used to specify a custom name of the creating subnetpool, and now it is
    used to specify the name of a pre-existing subnetpool. As a result,
    subnetpools created with custom name in before are now treated as external
    resources and won't be cleanup on deletion. Users need to cleanup the
    resources manually.
